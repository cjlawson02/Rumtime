# Bench Rig Firmware

Phase 0–1 firmware for **ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1** + **TB6612FNG** driving two Kamoer KPHM100-class pumps, plus **HX711** load cell for Tests 7–9.

## Wiring (default pins in `include/config.h`)

| GND        | GND           | Common ground with ESP32       |

Pump motor terminals connect to A+/A− and B+/B−. **Use a hardware switch on the 12 V pump supply.**

### HX711 breakout (SparkFun SEN-13879) → ESP32-S3

| HX711 pin | ESP32-S3 GPIO | Notes                          |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| VCC       | 3.3 V         | Not 5 V on ESP32-S3            |
| GND       | GND           | Common with TB6612 / ESP32     |
| DT (DOUT) | 1             | Change in `config.h` if needed |
| SCK       | 2             | Change in `config.h` if needed |

### Load cell (SparkFun SEN-14729 TAL220B)

Wire per SparkFun hookup guide: **Red** E+, **Black** E−, **White** A−, **Green** A+ to HX711 screw terminals. Mount the cell under the glass platform with mechanical isolation from pump vibration (see `docs/08-mechanical-design.md`).

GPIO **1** and **2** are free on the DevKitC-1 header and do not overlap pump pins (4–7, 15–17). Avoid strapping pins 0, 45, 46.

### Flow-gated dispense

`dispense-gated` starts the pump, waits until weight rises above `flowcfg` threshold for N consecutive samples (or times out), then runs the ml timer from that moment. Flow polling uses single-sample reads at ~10 Hz (15 ms interval). Output:

```text
ok=yes|no
gated_delay_ms=<motor-on to flow onset>
timed_ms=<pour duration after gate>
mass_delta_g=<net mass increase>
```

Timed `dispense` keeps motor-on as t=0 for comparison in Test 9.

## Calibration workflow

### Pumps

1. Prime: `prime 1 10000` (adjust ms until nozzle wets).
2. Cal pour: `cal run 1 20` → measure ml in cylinder.
3. Compute ml/s = ml / 20 → `cal 1 <ml_per_s>`.
4. Verify: `dispense 1 30` three times; log in `docs/14-bench-test-protocol.md`.
5. Tune: `antidrip 1 400` (or other ms per test protocol).

### Load cell

1. Empty platform → `tare`.
2. Place known mass (e.g. 200 g) → `weight`; adjust `scalecal <factor>` until reading matches.
3. Re-`tare` with glass on platform before pours.

Default calibration factor is in `config.h` (`kScaleCalibrationFactor`); expect to tune on bench.

### Test 7 — Load cell baseline

| Step | Commands / action                                                                                                                        |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7.1  | Empty platform → `tare` → `weight` (stable ~0)                                                                                           |
| 7.2  | Place empty glass → `weight` (above ~20 g threshold by eye)                                                                              |
| 7.3  | Add ice → `tare` → `weight`                                                                                                              |
| 7.4  | `tare` → `dispense-gated 1 30` → check `mass_delta_g` ≈ 30                                                                               |
| 7.5  | No glass or blocked line → `dispense-gated 1 30` → expect `ok=no` (timeout)                                                              |
| 7.6  | Tared glass; `weight-stream 100 30000`; in another session run `run 1 fwd 30000` / both pumps; compare `peak_abs_dW_g` vs flow threshold |

### Test 9 — Flow-gated vs timed

1. `status` — confirm ml/s, flowcfg, scale ready.
2. Glass on platform → `tare`.
3. **Timed:** `dispense 1 30` — note `mass_delta_g` vs 30 ml target.
4. **Gated:** `tare` → `dispense-gated 1 30` — compare `gated_delay_ms`, `timed_ms`, `mass_delta_g`.
5. Repeat 9.2–9.3 (de-primed / post–anti-drip) with both modes.
6. Tune: `flowcfg <threshold_g> <consecutive> <timeout_ms>` until gated meets tolerance.

Record tuning values in the bench test log table.

## Safety notes

- Firmware sets all outputs off at boot; still use pump power cutoff.
- Do not run reverse into ingredient bottles during cleaning experiments.
- Stall test manually with meter — firmware does not current-limit.
- Flow-gated polling uses single-sample HX711 reads with a 150 ms conversion timeout (~10 Hz effective rate with 15 ms poll interval). If the HX711 disconnects or stops responding, reads time out, `scale_ready` becomes `no` on `status`, and flow detection returns false until power-cycle / re-init.

## Next steps after Phase 1

Replace bench rig with I2C pump modules (PCA9685 + TB6612 on Altium PCB). This firmware stays as bring-up reference; main product firmware will live in a separate tree later.
